# Backpropagation
This is my attempt at implementing a basic Neural Networks interface to show how the back propagation algorithm works and how the structure of a network can influence the learning backpropagation facilitates.

To run the project:

1) Clone the repository
2) Create a virtual environment
3) Install all the dependencies by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4) `cd src`
5) `python3 run.py`

This will run the default run script. You can add your code and run the network.
